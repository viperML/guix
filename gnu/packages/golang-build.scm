;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; Modules (libraries) which are part of the Golang project but outside the
;;; main Golang tree, see <https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x>
;;;
;;; Since they are bound to be relied on by many, their dependencies should be
;;; kept minimal, and this module should not depend on other modules
;;; containing Golang packages.
;;;
;;; Please: Try to add new module packages in alphabetic order.

;;; Code:

;;;
;;; Avoid adding new packages to the end of this file. To reduce the chances
;;; of a merge conflict, place them above by existing packages with similar
;;; functionality or similar names.
